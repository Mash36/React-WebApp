# React-app-MERN
Building a complete React app with the MERN stack

This is the documentation for my first React app which I'll work on for 2 days straight on 24-25 March, 2017.

I'll be mainly using the programming language Javascript for it and scripting languages HTML and CSS. 

I was somewhat unsure which software stack to work with, MEAN or MERN. After surfing on the web for a bit, I found this great documentation from Vasan Subramanian in 2016 where he builds a React app with MERN stack. I'll be taking note from his blog and try to develop the web app for my development in web dev.

So what is a MERN stack?

M - MongoDB [NoSQL Database System]
E - Express.js [App Controller Layer]
R - React.js [Web App Presentation]
N - Node.js [Web Server]
